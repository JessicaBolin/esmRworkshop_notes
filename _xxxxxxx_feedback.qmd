# Feedback and contributing {.unnumbered}

If you have suggestions for improving the workshop, or run into a bug, we'd love to hear from you. We've outlined the steps for contributing and reporting bugs in the `README.md` associated with the workshop's [Github repository](https://github.com/JessicaBolin/esmRworkshop_notes).

Below are examples of feedback we've received from previous iterations of the workshop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*“The workshop was very well run, and the website notes were super helpful - the organizers did a great job!”*

*“Learning the theory and limitations of the models themselves was especially helpful when thinking about how to apply these methods to my own work.”*

*“Thank you for having this workshop at BML! It is hard for residents at BML to access these kinds of workshops, so I really appreciate it.”*

*“\[The instructors\] did a great job explaining all the complicated concepts and answered any questions we had!”*

*“Exceeded my expectations. I wasn't expecting to learn all that we learned and I feel well-prepared to work with model outputs and build on the code/materials we received.*

*“I didn't know where to look for resources, and so being provided resources, code, and a walk-through was super helpful and has made me feel more confident on where to start.”*

*“I think it was the perfect blend of theory and practice! I am grateful to have so many new resources to explore! I think the various different scripts will help me learn the steps. Thank you so much for sharing these resources and for explaining everything so well! I had a blast!”*

*“I now have great code that I can use for other projects (and that I actually understand). We went through so many important steps. Thank you!!! Most beautiful workshop website ever.”*

*“I especially liked when we walked through each of the functions so I knew what was happening there, and then having plots to show intermediate steps.”*

*"I learned a lot of foundational skills in downloading and plotting ESM data. As someone with no experience with this kind of data before, it was really helpful."*
