# What is an ESM?

Earth System Models are a numerical representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that operate across the atmosphere, cryosphere, ocean, and land. [They use mathematical laws and equations](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work/#inout) to simulate how climate has changed in the recent and even distant past, and how it might evolve in the future, subject to different plausible scenarios of future human development and greenhouse gas emission pathways.

# Model jargon

You may have heard the terms climate model, Earth System model (ESM), general circulation model (GCM) and coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). These are not all interchangeable! Historically, a 'climate model' referred to AOGCMs or GCMs, which do not simulate biogeochemical processes. ESMs, on the other hand, evolved from GCMs to simulate ocean chemistry and marine plankton due to their important in carbon cycling. As such, ESMs simulate the 3D evolution of the ocean and its biogeochemical processes.

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is currently in its sixth iteration, and coordinates the release and updates of climate models in line with the schedule of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. CMIP6 consist of 'runs' or model results from [\~100 distinct climate models](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_source_id.html) produced across [49 different modeling groups](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_institution_id.html) around the world.

## Experiments

Modelers run different **experiments** to simulate past, present and future climates (e.g., what would happen if we suddenly quadrupled CO2, or, if CO2 gradually increased from pre-industrial levels by 1% per year). A full list of CMIP6 experiments can be found [here](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_experiment_id.html).

Not all modeling centers run the same experiments in their ESMs. However, each ESM contains the **historical** simulation, where the ESM is run over the historical period, defined as 1850-2014. The historical runs are not fit to observed data, but rather, emerge from the physics of the model. This allows modelers to run hindcasts of the model (i.e., predictions of past climate), which are then compared to recorded climate observations. If the hindcasts are good at simulating observed reality, this gives modelers more confidence in the model projections.

Another set of experiments are future warming scenarios, termed **SSPs**, which are detailed below.

## Climate scenarios (SSPs)

Climate scenarios represent plausible storylines of future changes in population, demographics, and energy use. In CMIP5, scenarios were expressed as **representative concentration pathways (RCPs)** which describe greenhouse gas emission pathways (offset by other emissions) that result in specified levels of radiative forcing in 2100.

In CMIP6, climate scenarios now incorporate narratives describing alternative **shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)**, particularly relating to the Paris Agreement. The five most common SSPs in CMIP6 are listed below (*sensu* Table 2 and Figure 1 in [@SCHOEMAN2023]).

## ESMs we're using today!

Today, we are using ocean temperature output from two ESMs, that are part of the CMIP6 effort: `ACCESS-CM2` [@BI2020] and `IPSL-CM6A-LR` [@BOUCHER2020]. We are using output for two climate scenarios: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5.

Below, we've detailed key sub-model components for those interested:

`ACCESS-CM2` represents one of Australia's contributions to CMIP6.\
- Atmosphere: `UM10.6 GA7.1`\
- Land surface: `CABLE v2.5` (coupled to the UM)\
- Sea ice: `CICE5.1.2`\
- Ocean: `MOM5`\
- Numerical coupler: `OASIS3-MCT`

`IPSL-CM6A-LR` represents one of France's contributions to CMIP6.\
- Atmosphere: `LMDZ6A-LR`\
- Land surface: `ORCHIDEE v2.0`\
