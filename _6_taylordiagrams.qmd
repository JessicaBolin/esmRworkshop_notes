# Evaluate accuracy of historical ESM projections

We need to evaluate whether our ESM outputs resemble the our observations during the historical time period (i.e., up to 2014). In our case, `OISST` runs from 1993 onwards, so we will assess skill for 1993-2014. We can do this using **Taylor Diagrams** [@TAYLOR2001], which are common tools in climate science for assessing accuracy between model predictions and reference values (typically direct observations).

## Brief explainer

Taylor Diagrams tell you the degree of pattern correspondence between two datasets (i.e., accuracy). The diagram provides the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square difference between the ESM simulations and observed data, along with the ratio of standard deviations of the two patterns, **all in one diagram**.

-   Correlation coefficient (R) = quantifies pattern similarity. Shown on the plot by the azimuthal position of the simulated field.\
-   Root-mean-square difference RMS (RMS) = quantifies pattern differences. RMS approaches 0 as patterns are more alike. Shown on plot in the same units as the standard deviation. Proportional to distance apart.\
-   Standard deviation (SD) = variances. Shown on the plot as the radial distance from the origin.

## Create dataframes of baseline climatologies

We want a data-frame for each product (i.e., OISST raw observations, raw un-bias-corrected ESMs, and the bias-corrected ensemble mean) containing the average SST for each grid cell across 1994-2014.

```{r, message=F, warning = F}
#| code-fold: true
#| crop: true
library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
pth <- "/Users/admin/Documents/GitHub/BMLworkshop"

oisst <- rast(paste0(pth, "/__data/bias_correct/_2_OISST_climatology.nc"))
access_bc <- rast(paste0(pth, "/__data/bias_correct/esm/_4_bias_corrected/tos_mo_ACCESS-CM2_1994-2014_bc_historical_remapped.nc"))
ipsl_bc <- rast(paste0(pth, "/__data/bias_correct/esm/_4_bias_corrected/tos_mo_IPSL-CM6A-LR_1994-2014_bc_historical_remapped.nc"))
access_raw <- rast(paste0(pth, "/__data/cmip6_processed/tos_Omon_ACCESS-CM2_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc"))
access_raw <- access_raw[[time(access_raw) > "1994-01-01"]]
ipsl_raw <- rast(paste0(pth, "/__data/cmip6_processed/tos_Omon_IPSL-CM6A-LR_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn_185001-201412.nc"))
ipsl_raw <- ipsl_raw[[time(ipsl_raw) > "1994-01-01"]]


# Convert rasters to dataframes -------------------------------------------

# Calculate mean of each field (i.e., baseline/climatology)
oisst_df <- oisst %>% mean %>% as.data.frame(xy = T)
access_df <- access_raw %>% mean %>% as.data.frame(xy = T)
access_bc_df <- access_bc %>% mean %>% as.data.frame(xy = T)
ipsl_df <- ipsl_raw %>% mean %>% as.data.frame(xy = T)
ipsl_bc_df <- ipsl_bc %>% mean %>% as.data.frame(xy = T)


# Merge and fix names -----------------------------------------------------

alldata <- inner_join(oisst_df, access_df, by = c("x","y")) 
names(alldata) <- c("x", "y", "oisst_mean", "access_mean")
alldata <- inner_join(alldata, access_bc_df, by = c("x","y"))
names(alldata) <- c("x", "y", "oisst_mean", "access_mean", "access_bc_mean")

alldata2 <- inner_join(oisst_df, ipsl_df, by = c("x","y")) 
names(alldata2) <- c("x", "y", "oisst_mean", "ipsl_mean")
alldata2 <- inner_join(alldata2, ipsl_bc_df, by = c("x","y"))
names(alldata2) <- c("x", "y", "oisst_mean", "ipsl_mean", "ipsl_bc_mean")

alldata <- inner_join(alldata, alldata2)

alldata <- alldata %>% #ensemble mean
  mutate(ens_bc_mean = (access_bc_mean + ipsl_bc_mean) / 2)

alldata %>% head
```

## Construct Taylor Diagram

Then, we plot our Taylor Diagram. Our `OISST` observations (i.e., reality) is the red circle. If our models perfectly represent reality, they should all plot on top of this circle. In this case, the raw `ACCESS-CM2` historical run does OK at simulating reality, with a correlation of \~80%. `IPSL` does slightly worse at around 75%. However, the bias-corrected ensemble average of the two models (i.e., black triangle) plots directly on top of our observations, with almost a 1:1 correlation, meaning it does **really well** at simulating reality, at least for 1994-2014! Further, the bias-corrected ensemble mean has an improved RMSE (i.e., close to 0) and normalized standard deviation (i.e., 1).

This diagram demonstrates **the sheer value** of bias-correcting ESM outputs, before making projections.

```{r, eval = F}

               alldata$oisst_mean,

               normalize=TRUE, #normalize models so ref has SD of 1
               sd.arcs=TRUE,  #display arcs along SD axes

               pch = 19,

               xlab = "Standard deviation (normalised)",
               pos.cor = T, #show correlation (y-axis) from 0-1 
               gamma.col = "blue", #RMSE arcs
