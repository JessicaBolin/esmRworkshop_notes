# About {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the workshop! This workshop is designed to assist you in getting started with using Earth System Model (ESM) outputs using R.

The workshop will run from X am to X pm (PST) on day month 2025.

## Instructors

Today's instructors are **Jessica Bolin**, **Mikaela Provost** \[and others\].

**Jessie** is a Postdoc in Provost Lab, working on modeling and mapping climate refugia for red abalone across California. Jessie has a background in quantitative marine science and obtained her PhD from the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2024, and has broad research interests spanning climate adaptation, fisheries forecasting, marine disease ecology and sustainable seafood. Jessie has been using R since 2016, and has worked with ESMs since 2021. `jabbolin@ucdavis.edu`

**Mikaela** is an Assistant Professor at UC Davis, and the leader of Provost Lab. `mmprovost@ucdavis.edu`

For further information or questions regarding this workshop, please contact Jessie or Mikaela.

## Workshop materials

The workshop data are \~`15 GB`, so ensure you have enough storage space on your machine before downloading. If you don't have enough storage on your local machine, bring an external SSD/Hard-drive.

If you're a Github user, you can fork and clone the workshop repository [here](#0). Then, you will then need to download the workshop data [here](#0), which needs to be copied into the root directory. We've added the `/data` folder to the `.gitignore` file within the root directory, since we'll be working with large files (and Github breaks when pushing/pulling large files).

If you're not familiar with Github, you can download the complete workshop repository [here]() as a `.zip` file.

Alternatively, you can obtain the materials on the day from us via USB.

We have inserted the expected time duration for running processor-intensive chunks of code in **blockquotes** throughout the eBook. This is based on Jessie's machine (MacBook Pro 2023 M3 Max 64 GB Memory). Your machine may be faster or slower, depending on its specifications.

## What to bring

-   Laptop (highly, highly, highly recommend `macOS`) with internet connection. **Please ensure you have administrator permissions** - consult with your IT department on how to do this. Windows laptops are OK, but the instructors are all macOS natives - we will be using macOS during the workshop, and are unlikely to be able to fix any Windows-related software installation problems.

-   Install the necessary software, listed on the `Prerequisites` page.

## Expected outcomes

By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

-   Download, inspect, and wrangle netCDF file formats within R
-   Use `CDO` to speed up netCDF file manipulation
-   Download ESM output from ESGF and understand terminology re. variables/naming conventions
-   Remap and bias-correct ESM outputs from the CMIP6 suite across multiple climate scenarios and time periods
-   Make publication-quality maps

## Transportation to/from UC Davis

We have arranged for a UCD minivan to transport participants to/from UC Davis main campus, if needed. We have space for 12 participants - first-in, first-served. Sign up here. (TBD)

## Food

Lunch will be provided, with vegan and vegetarian options available. Coffee and snacks will be available throughout the day.

## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge funding from the UC Davis Coastal and Marine Science Institute's internal grant scheme (2024-2025), and thank Bodega Marine Laboratory for providing space and equipment to run the workshop.

We are very thankful for Barb Muhling (NOAA SWFSC) and Alice Pidd (UniSC) who reviewed workshop materials. We also thank Isaac Brito-Morales for developing the following `R` workshop materials [here](https://isaakbm.github.io/NACECC_workshop_2024/) and [here](https://isaakbm.github.io/ESM_240/) on analysing netCDFs and climate data, which our workshop took inspiration from. We also thank Dave Schoeman who developed and shared the first iteration of some code in this workshop, and who introduced Jessie to the world of climate models in the first place!
